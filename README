  public class test {
  
    public static void main(String argv[]) {
       
       Perl.eval("print qq`Hello World!\n` ;") ;

       SV foo = Perl.NEW("foo") ; // $foo = new foo() ;

       String s = Perl.eval(" 'time: ' + time() ") ;
       
       int i = Perl.eval_int(" 2**10 ") ; // 1024

       int n = Perl.eval_int(" 10/3 ") ; // 3

       ///////////////////
       
       SV array = Perl.eval_sv("  [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ]  ") ;
       
       String e0 = array.elem(0) ; // a
       String e1 = array.elem(1) ; // b
       String e2 = array.elem(2) ; // c
       
       ///////////////////
       
       SV hash = Perl.eval_sv("  { a => 11 , b => 22 , c => 33 }  ") ;
       
       String k_a = hash.key("a") ; // 11
       String k_b = hash.key("b") ; // 22

=> PREREQUISITES

*> JAVA SDK 1.4+

Home & Download:

http://java.sun.com/

*> Perl 5.6+

Home:

http://www.perl.com/

Download from:

http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActivePerl

http://www.activestate.com/Solutions/Programmer/Perl.plex

=> BUILD/INSTALL

First install the Java and Perl binaries.

Don't forget to set the enverioment variables for Java. Examples:

  JAVA_BIN=C:\j2sdk1.4.0\bin
  JAVA_HOME=C:\j2sdk1.4.0
  JAVA_INCLUDE=C:\j2sdk1.4.0\include

You also will need to have the Java and Perl binaries in the search PATH:

  PATH=C:\j2sdk1.4.0\bin;C:\Perl\bin\;%PATH%

After have the binaries well installed just type:

  Perl MakeFile.PL
  nmake

Now you are able to run the test.java example:

  nmake test
  ## or:
  java test

I<Note that after build PLJava you will have a I<./built> directory with all the
files needed to be with your Java application. In this directory you also will
have the test.java example to test it in this directory.>

Enjoy!

=> Java package: perl5

All the compiled Java classed will be inside the I<perl5> package/directory.

To use PLJava from your Java application you will need this files in the main
diretory of your application:

  PLJava.dll     ## The PLJava library that loads the Perl interpreter.
  PLJava.pm      ## Perl side of PLJava.
  Perl56.dll     ## The Perl library in case that you have Perl built dynamic.
  perl5/*        ## Diretory with PLJava classes.
  lib/*          ## A Perl lib directory with basic .pm files (strict, warnings, etc...)


I<Take a look in the ./built directory after build PLJava.>

=> SWIG

The source files generated by SWIG (I<PLJava.java, PLJava_wrap.c, PLJavaJNI.java>)
come already built for your convenience. If you want to install SWIG to generate this files again
just type:

  nmake swig

Home:

http://www.swig.org/

Download from:

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swigwin-1.3.21.zip

I<** Don't forget to add SWIG in the search PATH:>

  PATH=C:\SWIG-1.3.21;%PATH%

=> Win32

You will need to have VC++ 6+ to compile PLJava, since your Perl version for Win32 (from ActiveState)
will be probably compiled with VC++, and we need the same compiler of the interpreter
to embed a Perl program.

=> Linux

I haven't tested it on Linux yet, but should work!

=> Threads

The support to call Perl from Java from multiple Java Threads was added and tested on Win32, where Threads are native.

Note that if you are compiling PLJava with Perl 5.8+ you can use Perl Threads too.
